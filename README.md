# Yzma's potion Machine


Inspired one of my favorite childhood movies, the object of this game is to have all the matching potions to help Yzma kick Kuzsco off the throne. 
To begin all you have to do is press the play button, and to play again just click the try again button to reset the game.

In the future, I plan to add more transitions depending on if the player won or lost, I want to add a story line, and maybe audio.
